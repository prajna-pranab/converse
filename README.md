## Converse with your Conversol (or other Voltronic OEM controller)

Monitoring and management for Voltronic, Conversol, Axpert and other solar/inverters using similar protocols

This software was written for and tested on a Conversol III MPPT charge controller/inverted using information gleaned from various versions of the Voltronic 4048 protocol spec, decompiling the Voltronic WatchPower management software and a number of forum threads discussing these inverter/controllers.

So far it only supports sending various status enquiries and parsing responses.

It is using node.js in the electron framework.
